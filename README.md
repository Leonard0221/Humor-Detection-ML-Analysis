### Dataset Description

Dataset used [Link](https://github.com/CrowdTruth/Short-Text-Corpus-For-Humor-Detection)

### Project Explanation:
* You can find a paper in the folder, named Final_Project_Paper.pdf
### Project Explanation:
* For simple regression model, please check the humor_detection.py file.
* For RNN, please check the Humor_detection_RNN.ipynb file. For Keras is very difficult to function in local notebook.
* For the presentation, please forgive us that we have to record in the dorm common room, the environment is a little noisy.
